<h3 class="section">3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</h3>

<p><a name="index-options-to-control-warnings-310"></a><a name="index-warning-messages-311"></a><a name="index-messages_002c-warning-312"></a><a name="index-suppressing-warnings-313"></a>
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.

 <p>The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.

     
<a name="index-syntax-checking-314"></a>
<dl><dt><code>-fsyntax-only</code><dd><a name="index-fsyntax_002donly-315"></a>Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.

     <br><dt><code>-fmax-errors=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fmax_002derrors-316"></a>Limits the maximum number of error messages to <var>n</var>, at which point
GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If <var>n</var> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If <samp><span class="option">-Wfatal-errors</span></samp> is also
specified, then <samp><span class="option">-Wfatal-errors</span></samp> takes precedence over this
option.

     <br><dt><code>-w</code><dd><a name="index-w-317"></a>Inhibit all warning messages.

     <br><dt><code>-Werror</code><dd><a name="index-Werror-318"></a><a name="index-Wno_002derror-319"></a>Make all warnings into errors.

     <br><dt><code>-Werror=</code><dd><a name="index-Werror_003d-320"></a><a name="index-Wno_002derror_003d-321"></a>Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example <samp><span class="option">-Werror=switch</span></samp> turns the warnings
controlled by <samp><span class="option">-Wswitch</span></samp> into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate <samp><span class="option">-Werror</span></samp> for specific
warnings; for example <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=switch</span></samp> makes
<samp><span class="option">-Wswitch</span></samp> warnings not be errors, even when <samp><span class="option">-Werror</span></samp>
is in effect.

     <p>The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
<samp><span class="option">-Werror=</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=</span></samp> as described above. 
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
<samp><span class="option">-fno-diagnostics-show-option</span></samp> flag.)

     <p>Note that specifying <samp><span class="option">-Werror=</span></samp><var>foo</var> automatically implies
<samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp><var>foo</var>.  However, <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=</span></samp><var>foo</var> does not
imply anything.

     <br><dt><code>-Wfatal-errors</code><dd><a name="index-Wfatal_002derrors-322"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dfatal_002derrors-323"></a>This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.

 </dl>

 <p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-W</span></samp>&rsquo;, for example <samp><span class="option">-Wimplicit</span></samp> to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Wno-</span></samp>&rsquo; to turn off warnings; for
example, <samp><span class="option">-Wno-implicit</span></samp>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and
<a href="Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.

 <p>Some options, such as <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp>, turn on other
options, such as <samp><span class="option">-Wunused</span></samp>, which may turn on further options,
such as <samp><span class="option">-Wunused-value</span></samp>. The combined effect of positive and
negative forms is that more specific options have priority over less
specific ones, independently of their position in the command-line. For
options of the same specificity, the last one takes effect. Options
enabled or disabled via pragmas (see <a href="Diagnostic-Pragmas.html#Diagnostic-Pragmas">Diagnostic Pragmas</a>) take effect
as if they appeared at the end of the command-line.

 <p>When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
<samp><span class="option">-Wunknown-warning</span></samp>), GCC emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the <samp><span class="option">-Wno-</span></samp> form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for <samp><span class="option">-Wno-unknown-warning</span></samp> unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new <samp><span class="option">-Wno-</span></samp> options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-Wpedantic</code><dt><code>-pedantic</code><dd><a name="index-pedantic-324"></a><a name="index-Wpedantic-325"></a>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> option used.

     <p>Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> or a
<samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<code>__extension__</code>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them. 
See <a href="Alternate-Keywords.html#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

     <p>Some users try to use <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all&mdash;only those for which
ISO C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.

     <p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp>.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.

     <p>Where the standard specified with <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu90</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu99</span></samp>&rsquo;, there is a
corresponding <dfn>base standard</dfn>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)

     <br><dt><code>-pedantic-errors</code><dd><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-326"></a>Give an error whenever the <dfn>base standard</dfn> (see <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp>)
requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is undefined behavior
at compile-time and in some other cases that do not prevent compilation
of programs that are valid according to the standard. This is not
equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-Werror=pedantic</span></samp>, since there are errors enabled
by this option and not enabled by the latter and vice versa.

     <br><dt><code>-Wall</code><dd><a name="index-Wall-327"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dall-328"></a>This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and <a href="Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.

</pre>
     <p>Note that some warning flags are not implied by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.  Some of
them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp> but many of
them must be enabled individually.

     <br><dt><code>-Wextra</code><dd><a name="index-W-329"></a><a name="index-Wextra-330"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dextra-331"></a>This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by

     <p>The option <samp><span class="option">-Wextra</span></samp> also prints warning messages for the
following cases:

          <ul>
<li>A pointer is compared against integer zero with <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>,
<code>&gt;</code>, or <code>&gt;=</code>.

          <li>(C++ only) An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a

          <li>(C++ only) Taking the address of a variable that has been declared

of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines. 
This warning is enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wchkp</code><dd><a name="index-Wchkp-334"></a>Warn about an invalid memory access that is found by Pointer Bounds Checker

<samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp> option. 
If a source file is changed between compiling with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-gen</span></samp> and
with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp>, the files with the profile feedback can fail
to match the source file and GCC cannot use the profile feedback
information.  By default, this warning is enabled and is treated as an
error.  <samp><span class="option">-Wno-coverage-mismatch</span></samp> can be used to disable the
warning or <samp><span class="option">-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</span></samp> can be used to
disable the error.  Disabling the error for this warning can result in
poorly optimized code and is useful only in the
case of very minor changes such as bug fixes to an existing code-base. 
Completely disabling the warning is not recommended.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-cpp</code><dd><span class="roman">(C, Objective-C, C++, Objective-C++ and Fortran only)</span>

     <p>Suppress warning messages emitted by <code>#warning</code> directives.

floating-point unit implement <code>float</code> in hardware, but emulate
<code>double</code> in software.  On such a machine, doing computations
using <code>double</code> values is much more expensive because of the
overhead required for software emulation.

     <p>It is easy to accidentally do computations with <code>double</code> because
floating-point literals are implicitly of type <code>double</code>.  For
example, in:
     <pre class="smallexample">          float area(float radius)

the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string

sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes (see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>), in the <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> and <code>strfmon</code> (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families). 
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
<samp><span class="option">-ffreestanding</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fno-builtin</span></samp>.

     <p>The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU
libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some BSD and GNU
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; GCC does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library's limitations.  However, if <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp> is used
with <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp>, warnings are given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for <code>strfmon</code> formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).  See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

<samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> also checks for null format arguments for several
functions, <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> also implies <samp><span class="option">-Wnonnull</span></samp>.  Some

that such arguments are ignored.

          <p>Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to <code>va_arg</code> to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of <code>scanf</code> formats, this option suppresses the

employs a conservative approach that warns only about calls that most
likely overflow the buffer.  At this level, numeric arguments to format
directives with unknown values are assumed to have the value of one, and
strings of unknown length to be empty.  Numeric arguments that are known
to be bounded to a subrange of their type, or string arguments whose output
is bounded either by their directive's precision or by a finite set of
string literals, are assumed to take on the value within the range that
results in the most bytes on output.  For example, the call to <code>sprintf</code>
below is diagnosed because even with both <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> equal to zero,
the terminating NUL character (<code>'\0'</code>) appended by the function
to the destination buffer will be written past its end.  Increasing
the size of the buffer by a single byte is sufficient to avoid the
warning, though it may not be sufficient to avoid the overflow.

               <pre class="smallexample">                    void f (int a, int b)
                    {
                      char buf [13];
                      sprintf (buf, "a = %i, b = %i\n", a, b);
                    }
</pre>
               <br><dt><code>-Wformat-overflow=2</code><dd>Level <var>2</var> warns also about calls that might overflow the destination
buffer given an argument of sufficient length or magnitude.  At level
<var>2</var>, unknown numeric arguments are assumed to have the minimum
representable value for signed types with a precision greater than 1, and
the maximum representable value otherwise.  Unknown string arguments whose
length cannot be assumed to be bounded either by the directive's precision,
or by a finite set of string literals they may evaluate to, or the character
array they may point to, are assumed to be 1 character long.

               <p>At level <var>2</var>, the call in the example above is again diagnosed, but
this time because with <var>a</var> equal to a 32-bit <code>INT_MIN</code> the first
<code>%i</code> directive will write some of its digits beyond the end of
the destination buffer.  To make the call safe regardless of the values
of the two variables, the size of the destination buffer must be increased
to at least 34 bytes.  GCC includes the minimum size of the buffer in
an informational note following the warning.

               <p>An alternative to increasing the size of the destination buffer is to
constrain the range of formatted values.  The maximum length of string
arguments can be bounded by specifying the precision in the format
directive.  When numeric arguments of format directives can be assumed
to be bounded by less than the precision of their type, choosing
an appropriate length modifier to the format specifier will reduce
the required buffer size.  For example, if <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> in the
example above can be assumed to be within the precision of
the <code>short int</code> type then using either the <code>%hi</code> format
directive or casting the argument to <code>short</code> reduces the maximum
required size of the buffer to 24 bytes.

               <pre class="smallexample">                    void f (int a, int b)

of sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.

     <p>The C and C++ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/C++
program are evaluated in terms of <dfn>sequence points</dfn>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>? :</code> or <code>,</code> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places. 
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.

     <p>It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that &ldquo;Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression. 
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.&rdquo;.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.

     <p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are <code>a = a++;</code>, <code>a[n]
= b[n++]</code> and <code>a[i++] = i;</code>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.

     <p>The C++17 standard will define the order of evaluation of operands in
more cases: in particular it requires that the right-hand side of an
assignment be evaluated before the left-hand side, so the above
examples are no longer undefined.  But this warning will still warn
about them, to help people avoid writing code that is undefined in C
and earlier revisions of C++.

     <p>The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.

definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at

cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It is

It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the

Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives). 
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>
works. 
<samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-aliasing</span></samp> is equivalent to <samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-aliasing=3</span></samp>.

     <p>Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate. 
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but <samp><span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span></samp> still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives. 
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.

     <p>Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise. 
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1). 
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.

     <p>Level 3 (default for <samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-aliasing</span></samp>):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled. 
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
<code>*(int*)&amp;some_float</code>. 
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information. 
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced. 
Does not warn about incomplete types.

It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.

     <p>An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.

          <dl>
<dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=1</code><dd>Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For
example the compiler simplifies

<samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-overflow</span></samp> is enabled by <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.

          <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=2</code><dd>Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: <code>abs (x) &gt;= 0</code>.  This can only be
simplified when signed integer overflow is undefined, because
<code>abs (INT_MIN)</code> overflows to <code>INT_MIN</code>, which is less than
zero.  <samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-overflow</span></samp> (with no level) is the same as
<samp><span class="option">-Wstrict-overflow=2</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=3</code><dd>Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For

For example: <code>(x * 10) / 5</code> is simplified to <code>x * 2</code>.

          <br><dt><code>-Wstrict-overflow=5</code><dd>Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: <code>x + 2 &gt; y</code> is
simplified to <code>x + 1 &gt;= y</code>.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level gives a very large number of
false positives.

The argument is meaningful only for functions that operate on character arrays

just a subset of buffer overflows detected by the corresponding overflow

<code>strncpy</code>, and <code>stpncpy</code> that may either truncate the copied string
or leave the destination unchanged.

     <p>In the following example, the call to <code>strncat</code> specifies a bound that
is less than the length of the source string.  As a result, the copy of
the source will be truncated and so the call is diagnosed.  To avoid the
warning use <code>bufsize - strlen (buf) - 1)</code> as the bound.

     <p>As another example, the following call to <code>strncpy</code> results in copying
to <code>d</code> just the characters preceding the terminating NUL, without
appending the NUL to the end.  Assuming the result of <code>strncpy</code> is
necessarily a NUL-terminated string is a common mistake, and so the call
is diagnosed.  To avoid the warning when the result is not expected to be
NUL-terminated, call <code>memcpy</code> instead.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void copy (char *d, const char *s)

</pre>
     <p>In the following example, the call to <code>strncpy</code> specifies the size
of the destination buffer as the bound.  If the length of the source
string is equal to or greater than this size the result of the copy will
not be NUL-terminated.  Therefore, the call is also diagnosed.  To avoid
the warning, specify <code>sizeof buf - 1</code> as the bound and set the last
element of the buffer to <code>NUL</code>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void copy (const char *s)

     <p>In situations where a character array is intended to store a sequence
of bytes with no terminating <code>NUL</code> such an array may be annotated
with attribute <code>nonstring</code> to avoid this warning.  Such arrays,
however, are not suitable arguments to functions that expect

resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or

          <p>GCC also warns about function definitions that might be
candidates for <code>format</code> attributes.  Again, these are only
possible candidates.  GCC guesses that <code>format</code> attributes
might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like

     <br><dt><code>-Walloca-larger-than=</code><var>n</var><dd>This option warns on calls to <code>alloca</code> that are not bounded by a
controlling predicate limiting its argument of integer type to at most
<var>n</var> bytes, or calls to <code>alloca</code> where the bound is unknown. 
Arguments of non-integer types are considered unbounded even if they
appear to be constrained to the expected range.

     <p>For example, a bounded case of <code>alloca</code> could be:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void func (size_t n)
          {
            void *p;

            else
              p = malloc (n);
            f (p);
          }
</pre>
     <p>In the above example, passing <code>-Walloca-larger-than=1000</code> would not
issue a warning because the call to <code>alloca</code> is known to be at most
1000 bytes.  However, if <code>-Walloca-larger-than=500</code> were passed,
the compiler would emit a warning.

     <p>Unbounded uses, on the other hand, are uses of <code>alloca</code> with no
controlling predicate constraining its integer argument.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void func ()
          {
            void *p = alloca (n);
            f (p);
          }
</pre>
     <p>If <code>-Walloca-larger-than=500</code> were passed, the above would trigger
a warning, but this time because of the lack of bounds checking.

     <p>Note, that even seemingly correct code involving signed integers could
cause a warning:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void func (signed int n)
          {
            if (n &lt; 500)
              {
                p = alloca (n);
                f (p);
              }
          }
</pre>
     <p>In the above example, <var>n</var> could be negative, causing a larger than
expected argument to be implicitly cast into the <code>alloca</code> call.

     <p>This option also warns when <code>alloca</code> is used in a loop.

A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run
time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is
used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it is
made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment.  But, for
most targets, it is made up of code and thus requires the stack to be
made executable in order for the program to work properly.

     <p>The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

     <br><dt><code>-Wtraditional </code><span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wtraditional-537"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dtraditional-538"></a>Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that should be avoided.

          <ul>
<li>Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body. 
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but in ISO C it does not.

          <li>In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist. 
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional</span></samp> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
<code>#pragma</code> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize <code>#elif</code>, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.

          <li>A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

          <li>The unary plus operator.

          <li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">U</span></samp>&rsquo; integer constant suffix, or the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo; floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>&rsquo; suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_MIN</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">_MAX</span></samp>&rsquo; macros in <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>. 
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however GCC's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.

          <li>A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.

          <li>A <code>switch</code> statement has an operand of type <code>long</code>.

          <li>A non-<code>static</code> function declaration follows a <code>static</code> one. 
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.

          <li>The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.

          <li>Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

          <li>Initialization of automatic aggregates.

          <li>Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.

          <li>Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <code>__STDC__</code> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.

          <li>Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings; for the full set use <samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional-conversion</span></samp>.

          <li>Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<em>not</em> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, <code>PARAMS</code> and
<code>VPARAMS</code>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

whose type is compatible with that of the shadowing variable. In C++,
type compatibility here means the type of the shadowing variable can be
converted to that of the shadowed variable. The creation of this flag
(in addition to <samp><span class="option">-Wshadow=local</span></samp>) is based on the idea that when
a local variable shadows another one of incompatible type, it is most
likely intentional, not a bug or typo, as shown in the following example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          for (SomeIterator i = SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i)
          {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
            {
              ...
            }
            ...
          }
</pre>
     <p>Since the two variable <code>i</code> in the example above have incompatible types,
enabling only <samp><span class="option">-Wshadow=compatible-local</span></samp> will not emit a warning. 
Because their types are incompatible, if a programmer accidentally uses one
in place of the other, type checking will catch that and emit an error or
warning. So not warning (about shadowing) in this case will not lead to
undetected bugs. Use of this flag instead of <samp><span class="option">-Wshadow=local</span></samp> can
possibly reduce the number of warnings triggered by intentional shadowing.

different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the ISO 10646 standard sets out some <dfn>normalization rules</dfn> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.

     <p>There are four levels of warning supported by GCC.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=nfc</span></samp>, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the ISO 10646 &ldquo;C&rdquo; normalized form, <dfn>NFC</dfn>.  NFC is the
recommended form for most uses.  It is equivalent to
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized</span></samp>.

     <p>Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into NFC, are not allowed in
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC. 
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=id</span></samp> suppresses the warning for these characters. 
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.

     <p>You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=none</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-Wno-normalized</span></samp>.  You should
only do this if you are using some other normalization scheme (like
&ldquo;D&rdquo;), because otherwise you can easily create bugs that are
literally impossible to see.

     <p>Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance <code>\u207F</code>, &ldquo;SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N&rdquo;, displays just like a regular <code>n</code> that has been
placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the <dfn>NFKC</dfn>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and GCC warns if your code is not in NFKC if you use
<samp><span class="option">-Wnormalized=nfkc</span></samp>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

maximum&rdquo; length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.

     <p>The limit applies <em>after</em> string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.

     <p>This option is implied by <samp><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span></samp>, and can be disabled with
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-overlength-strings</span></samp>.

Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
a suffix.  When used together with <samp><span class="option">-Wsystem-headers</span></samp> it
warns about such constants in system header files.  This can be useful
when preparing code to use with the <code>FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64</code> pragma
from the decimal floating-point extension to C99.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-designated-init </code><span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span><dd>Suppress warnings when a positional initializer is used to initialize
a structure that has been marked with the <code>designated_init</code>
attribute.

     <br><dt><code>-Whsa</code><dd>Issue a warning when HSAIL cannot be emitted for the compiled function or
OpenMP construct.
