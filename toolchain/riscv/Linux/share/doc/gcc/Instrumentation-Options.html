<h3 class="section">3.11 Program Instrumentation Options</h3>

<p><a name="index-instrumentation-options-1037"></a><a name="index-program-instrumentation-options-1038"></a><a name="index-run_002dtime-error-checking-options-1039"></a><a name="index-profiling-options-1040"></a><a name="index-options_002c-program-instrumentation-1041"></a><a name="index-options_002c-run_002dtime-error-checking-1042"></a><a name="index-options_002c-profiling-1043"></a>
GCC supports a number of command-line options that control adding
run-time instrumentation to the code it normally generates. 
For example, one purpose of instrumentation is collect profiling
statistics for use in finding program hot spots, code coverage
analysis, or profile-guided optimizations. 
Another class of program instrumentation is adding run-time checking
to detect programming errors like invalid pointer
dereferences or out-of-bounds array accesses, as well as deliberately
hostile attacks such as stack smashing or C++ vtable hijacking. 
There is also a general hook which can be used to implement other
forms of tracing or function-level instrumentation for debug or
program analysis purposes.

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bprof_007d-1044"></a>
<dl><dt><code>-p</code><dd><a name="index-p-1045"></a>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <samp><span class="command">prof</span></samp>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bgprof_007d-1046"></a><br><dt><code>-pg</code><dd><a name="index-pg-1047"></a>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <samp><span class="command">gprof</span></samp>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-arcs</code><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002darcs-1048"></a>Add code so that program flow <dfn>arcs</dfn> are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  On targets that support
constructors with priority support, profiling properly handles constructors,
destructors and C++ constructors (and destructors) of classes which are used
as a type of a global variable.

     <p>When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
<samp><var>auxname</var><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (<samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp>), or for
test coverage analysis (<samp><span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span></samp>).  Each object file's
<var>auxname</var> is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g. <samp><span class="file">foo.gcda</span></samp> for input file <samp><span class="file">dir/foo.c</span></samp>, or
<samp><span class="file">dir/foo.gcda</span></samp> for output file specified as <samp><span class="option">-o dir/foo.o</span></samp>). 
See <a href="Cross_002dprofiling.html#Cross_002dprofiling">Cross-profiling</a>.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bgcov_007d-1049"></a><br><dt><code>--coverage</code><dd><a name="index-coverage-1050"></a>
This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage
analysis.  The option is a synonym for <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>
<samp><span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span></samp> (when compiling) and <samp><span class="option">-lgcov</span></samp> (when
linking).  See the documentation for those options for more details.

          <ul>
<li>Compile the source files with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp> plus optimization
and code generation options.  For test coverage analysis, use the
additional <samp><span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span></samp> option.  You do not need to profile
every source file in a program.

          <li>Compile the source files additionally with <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-abs-path</span></samp>
to create absolute path names in the <samp><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp> files.  This allows
<samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> to find the correct sources in projects where compilations
occur with different working directories.

          <li>Link your object files with <samp><span class="option">-lgcov</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>
(the latter implies the former).

          <li>Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
information.  This may be repeated any number of times.  You can run
concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Unless
a strict ISO C dialect option is in effect, <code>fork</code> calls are
detected and correctly handled without double counting.

          <li>For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with
the same optimization and code generation options plus
<samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp> (see <a href="Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options">Options that Control Optimization</a>).

          <li>For test coverage analysis, use <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> to produce human readable
information from the <samp><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">.gcda</span></samp> files.  Refer to the
<samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> documentation for further information.

     </ul>

     <p>With <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, for each function of your program GCC
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph. 
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.

     <br><dt><code>-ftest-coverage</code><dd><a name="index-ftest_002dcoverage-1051"></a>Produce a notes file that the <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> code-coverage utility
(see <a href="Gcov.html#Gcov"><samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp>&mdash;a Test Coverage Program</a>) can use to
show program coverage.  Each source file's note file is called
<samp><var>auxname</var><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp>.  Refer to the <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp> option
above for a description of <var>auxname</var> and instructions on how to
generate test coverage data.  Coverage data matches the source files
more closely if you do not optimize.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-abs-path</code><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002dabs_002dpath-1052"></a>Automatically convert relative source file names to absolute path names
in the <samp><span class="file">.gcno</span></samp> files.  This allows <samp><span class="command">gcov</span></samp> to find the correct
sources in projects where compilations occur with different working
directories.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-dir=</code><var>path</var><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002ddir-1053"></a>
Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to <var>path</var>. 
This option affects only the profile data generated by
<samp><span class="option">-fprofile-generate</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>
and used by <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span></samp>
and its related options.  Both absolute and relative paths can be used. 
By default, GCC uses the current directory as <var>path</var>, thus the
profile data file appears in the same directory as the object file.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-generate</code><dt><code>-fprofile-generate=</code><var>path</var><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002dgenerate-1054"></a>
Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to produce
profile useful for later recompilation with profile feedback based
optimization.  You must use <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-generate</span></samp> both when
compiling and when linking your program.

     <p>The following options are enabled: <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-values</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-fvpt</span></samp>.

     <p>If <var>path</var> is specified, GCC looks at the <var>path</var> to find
the profile feedback data files. See <samp><span class="option">-fprofile-dir</span></samp>.

     <p>To optimize the program based on the collected profile information, use
<samp><span class="option">-fprofile-use</span></samp>.  See <a href="Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options">Optimize Options</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-update=</code><var>method</var><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002dupdate-1055"></a>
Alter the update method for an application instrumented for profile
feedback based optimization.  The <var>method</var> argument should be one of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">single</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">atomic</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prefer-atomic</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
The first one is useful for single-threaded applications,
while the second one prevents profile corruption by emitting thread-safe code.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> When an application does not properly join all threads
(or creates an detached thread), a profile file can be still corrupted.

     <p>Using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prefer-atomic</span></samp>&rsquo; would be transformed either to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">atomic</span></samp>&rsquo;,
when supported by a target, or to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">single</span></samp>&rsquo; otherwise.  The GCC driver
automatically selects &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">prefer-atomic</span></samp>&rsquo; when <samp><span class="option">-pthread</span></samp>
is present in the command line.

     <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=address</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003daddress-1056"></a>Enable AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector. 
Memory access instructions are instrumented to detect
out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs. 
The option enables <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope</span></samp>. 
See <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer</a> for
more details.  The run-time behavior can be influenced using the
<samp><span class="env">ASAN_OPTIONS</span></samp> environment variable.  When set to <code>help=1</code>,
the available options are shown at startup of the instrumented program.  See
<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags#run-time-flags">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags#run-time-flags</a>
for a list of supported options. 
The option cannot be combined with <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=thread</span></samp>
and/or <samp><span class="option">-fcheck-pointer-bounds</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=kernel-address</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dkernel_002daddress-1057"></a>Enable AddressSanitizer for Linux kernel. 
See <a href="https://github.com/google/kasan/wiki">https://github.com/google/kasan/wiki</a> for more details. 
The option cannot be combined with <samp><span class="option">-fcheck-pointer-bounds</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=pointer-compare</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dpointer_002dcompare-1058"></a>Instrument comparison operation (&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=) with pointer operands. 
The option must be combined with either <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=kernel-address</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=address</span></samp>
The option cannot be combined with <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=thread</span></samp>
and/or <samp><span class="option">-fcheck-pointer-bounds</span></samp>. 
Note: By default the check is disabled at run time.  To enable it,
add <code>detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=2</code> to the environment variable
<samp><span class="env">ASAN_OPTIONS</span></samp>. Using <code>detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=1</code> detects
invalid operation only when both pointers are non-null.

     <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=pointer-subtract</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dpointer_002dsubtract-1059"></a>Instrument subtraction with pointer operands. 
The option must be combined with either <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=kernel-address</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=address</span></samp>
The option cannot be combined with <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=thread</span></samp>
and/or <samp><span class="option">-fcheck-pointer-bounds</span></samp>. 
Note: By default the check is disabled at run time.  To enable it,
add <code>detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=2</code> to the environment variable
<samp><span class="env">ASAN_OPTIONS</span></samp>. Using <code>detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=1</code> detects
invalid operation only when both pointers are non-null.

     <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=thread</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dthread-1060"></a>Enable ThreadSanitizer, a fast data race detector. 
Memory access instructions are instrumented to detect
data race bugs.  See <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki#threadsanitizer">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki#threadsanitizer</a> for more
details. The run-time behavior can be influenced using the <samp><span class="env">TSAN_OPTIONS</span></samp>
environment variable; see
<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags</a> for a list of
supported options. 
The option cannot be combined with <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=address</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=leak</span></samp> and/or <samp><span class="option">-fcheck-pointer-bounds</span></samp>.

     <p>Note that sanitized atomic builtins cannot throw exceptions when
operating on invalid memory addresses with non-call exceptions
(<samp><span class="option">-fnon-call-exceptions</span></samp>).

     <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=leak</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dleak-1061"></a>Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector. 
This option only matters for linking of executables and
the executable is linked against a library that overrides <code>malloc</code>
and other allocator functions.  See
<a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer</a> for more
details.  The run-time behavior can be influenced using the
<samp><span class="env">LSAN_OPTIONS</span></samp> environment variable. 
The option cannot be combined with <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=thread</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=undefined</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dundefined-1062"></a>Enable UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, a fast undefined behavior detector. 
Various computations are instrumented to detect undefined behavior
at runtime.  Current suboptions are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>-fsanitize=shift</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dshift-1063"></a>This option enables checking that the result of a shift operation is
not undefined.  Note that what exactly is considered undefined differs
slightly between C and C++, as well as between ISO C90 and C99, etc. 
This option has two suboptions, <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=shift-base</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=shift-exponent</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=shift-exponent</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dshift_002dexponent-1064"></a>This option enables checking that the second argument of a shift operation
is not negative and is smaller than the precision of the promoted first
argument.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=shift-base</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dshift_002dbase-1065"></a>If the second argument of a shift operation is within range, check that the
result of a shift operation is not undefined.  Note that what exactly is
considered undefined differs slightly between C and C++, as well as between
ISO C90 and C99, etc.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dinteger_002ddivide_002dby_002dzero-1066"></a>Detect integer division by zero as well as <code>INT_MIN / -1</code> division.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=unreachable</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dunreachable-1067"></a>With this option, the compiler turns the <code>__builtin_unreachable</code>
call into a diagnostics message call instead.  When reaching the
<code>__builtin_unreachable</code> call, the behavior is undefined.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=vla-bound</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dvla_002dbound-1068"></a>This option instructs the compiler to check that the size of a variable
length array is positive.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=null</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dnull-1069"></a>This option enables pointer checking.  Particularly, the application
built with this option turned on will issue an error message when it
tries to dereference a NULL pointer, or if a reference (possibly an
rvalue reference) is bound to a NULL pointer, or if a method is invoked
on an object pointed by a NULL pointer.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=return</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dreturn-1070"></a>This option enables return statement checking.  Programs
built with this option turned on will issue an error message
when the end of a non-void function is reached without actually
returning a value.  This option works in C++ only.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dsigned_002dinteger_002doverflow-1071"></a>This option enables signed integer overflow checking.  We check that
the result of <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, and both unary and binary <code>-</code>
does not overflow in the signed arithmetics.  Note, integer promotion
rules must be taken into account.  That is, the following is not an
overflow:
          <pre class="smallexample">               signed char a = SCHAR_MAX;
               a++;
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=bounds</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dbounds-1072"></a>This option enables instrumentation of array bounds.  Various out of bounds
accesses are detected.  Flexible array members, flexible array member-like
arrays, and initializers of variables with static storage are not instrumented. 
The option cannot be combined with <samp><span class="option">-fcheck-pointer-bounds</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=bounds-strict</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dbounds_002dstrict-1073"></a>This option enables strict instrumentation of array bounds.  Most out of bounds
accesses are detected, including flexible array members and flexible array
member-like arrays.  Initializers of variables with static storage are not
instrumented.  The option cannot be combined
with <samp><span class="option">-fcheck-pointer-bounds</span></samp>.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=alignment</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dalignment-1074"></a>
This option enables checking of alignment of pointers when they are
dereferenced, or when a reference is bound to insufficiently aligned target,
or when a method or constructor is invoked on insufficiently aligned object.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=object-size</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dobject_002dsize-1075"></a>This option enables instrumentation of memory references using the
<code>__builtin_object_size</code> function.  Various out of bounds pointer
accesses are detected.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dfloat_002ddivide_002dby_002dzero-1076"></a>Detect floating-point division by zero.  Unlike other similar options,
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</span></samp> is not enabled by
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=undefined</span></samp>, since floating-point division by zero can
be a legitimate way of obtaining infinities and NaNs.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dfloat_002dcast_002doverflow-1077"></a>This option enables floating-point type to integer conversion checking. 
We check that the result of the conversion does not overflow. 
Unlike other similar options, <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</span></samp> is
not enabled by <samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=undefined</span></samp>. 
This option does not work well with <code>FE_INVALID</code> exceptions enabled.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=nonnull-attribute</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dnonnull_002dattribute-1078"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of calls, checking whether null values
are not passed to arguments marked as requiring a non-null value by the
<code>nonnull</code> function attribute.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=returns-nonnull-attribute</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dreturns_002dnonnull_002dattribute-1079"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of return statements in functions
marked with <code>returns_nonnull</code> function attribute, to detect returning
of null values from such functions.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=bool</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dbool-1080"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of loads from bool.  If a value other
than 0/1 is loaded, a run-time error is issued.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=enum</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003denum-1081"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of loads from an enum type.  If
a value outside the range of values for the enum type is loaded,
a run-time error is issued.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=vptr</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dvptr-1082"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of C++ member function calls, member
accesses and some conversions between pointers to base and derived classes,
to verify the referenced object has the correct dynamic type.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=pointer-overflow</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dpointer_002doverflow-1083"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of pointer arithmetics.  If the pointer
arithmetics overflows, a run-time error is issued.

          <br><dt><code>-fsanitize=builtin</code><dd><a name="index-fsanitize_003dbuiltin-1084"></a>
This option enables instrumentation of arguments to selected builtin
functions.  If an invalid value is passed to such arguments, a run-time
error is issued.  E.g. passing 0 as the argument to <code>__builtin_ctz</code>
or <code>__builtin_clz</code> invokes undefined behavior and is diagnosed
by this option.

     </dl>

     <p>While <samp><span class="option">-ftrapv</span></samp> causes traps for signed overflows to be emitted,
<samp><span class="option">-fsanitize=undefined</span></samp> gives a diagnostic message. 
This currently works only for the C family of languages.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-sanitize=all</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dsanitize_003dall-1085"></a>
This option disables all previously enabled sanitizers.

mentioned in comma-separated list of <var>opts</var>.  Enabling this option
for a sanitizer component causes it to attempt to continue
running the program as if no error happened.  This means multiple
runtime errors can be reported in a single program run, and the exit
code of the program may indicate success even when errors
have been reported.  The <samp><span class="option">-fno-sanitize-recover=</span></samp> option
can be used to alter
this behavior: only the first detected error is reported
and program then exits with a non-zero exit code.

the latter disables recovery for all sanitizers that support it.

     <p>Even if a recovery mode is turned on the compiler side, it needs to be also
enabled on the runtime library side, otherwise the failures are still fatal. 
The runtime library defaults to <code>halt_on_error=0</code> for
ThreadSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, while default value for
AddressSanitizer is <code>halt_on_error=1</code>. This can be overridden through
setting the <code>halt_on_error</code> flag in the corresponding environment variable.

     <p>Currently there
is only an implementation for Intel MPX available, thus x86 GNU/Linux target
and <samp><span class="option">-mmpx</span></samp> are required to enable this feature. 
MPX-based instrumentation requires
a runtime library to enable MPX in hardware and handle bounds
violation signals.  By default when <samp><span class="option">-fcheck-pointer-bounds</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">-mmpx</span></samp> options are used to link a program, the GCC driver
links against the <samp><span class="file">libmpx</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">libmpxwrappers</span></samp> libraries. 
Bounds checking on calls to dynamic libraries requires a linker
with <samp><span class="option">-z bndplt</span></samp> support; if GCC was configured with a linker
without support for this option (including the Gold linker and older
versions of ld), a warning is given if you link with <samp><span class="option">-mmpx</span></samp>
without also specifying <samp><span class="option">-static</span></samp>, since the overall effectiveness
of the bounds checking protection is reduced. 
See also <samp><span class="option">-static-libmpxwrappers</span></samp>.

     <p>MPX-based instrumentation
may be used for debugging and also may be included in production code
to increase program security.  Depending on usage, you may
have different requirements for the runtime library.  The current version
of the MPX runtime library is more oriented for use as a debugging
tool.  MPX runtime library usage implies <samp><span class="option">-lpthread</span></samp>.  See
also <samp><span class="option">-static-libmpx</span></samp>.  The runtime library  behavior can be
influenced using various <samp><span class="env">CHKP_RT_*</span></samp> environment variables.  See

file, be sure to delete any existing one.

     <br><dt><code>-fvtv-counts</code><dd><a name="index-fvtv_002dcounts-1145"></a>This is a debugging flag.  When used in conjunction with
<samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=std</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-fvtable-verify=preinit</span></samp>, this
causes the compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual calls
it encounters and the number of verifications it inserts.  It also
counts the number of calls to certain run-time library functions
that it inserts and logs this information for each compilation unit. 
The compiler writes this information to a file named
<samp><span class="file">vtv_count_data.log</span></samp> in the directory named by the environment
variable <samp><span class="env">VTV_LOGS_DIR</span></samp> if that is defined or the current working
directory otherwise.  It also counts the size of the vtable pointer sets
for each class, and writes this information to <samp><span class="file">vtv_class_set_sizes.log</span></samp>
in the same directory.

files, be sure to delete any existing ones.

     <br><dt><code>-finstrument-functions</code><dd><a name="index-finstrument_002dfunctions-1146"></a>Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions are called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
<code>__builtin_return_address</code> does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)

     <pre class="smallexample">          void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                                         void *call_site);
          void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                                         void *call_site);
</pre>
     <p>The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.

     <p>This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use <code>extern inline</code> in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)

     <p>A function may be given the attribute <code>no_instrument_function</code>, in
which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).

     <br><dt><code>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=</code><var>file</var><code>,</code><var>file</var><code>,...</code><dd><a name="index-finstrument_002dfunctions_002dexclude_002dfile_002dlist-1147"></a>
Set the list of functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see
the description of <samp><span class="option">-finstrument-functions</span></samp>).  If the file that
contains a function definition matches with one of <var>file</var>, then
that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on substrings:
if the <var>file</var> parameter is a substring of the file name, it is
considered to be a match.

     <p>For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">excludes any inline function defined in files whose pathnames
contain <samp><span class="file">/bits/stl</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">include/sys</span></samp>.

     <p>If, for some reason, you want to include letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo; in one of
<var>sym</var>, write &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\,</span></samp>&rsquo;. For example,
<samp><span class="option">-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list='\,\,tmp'</span></samp>
(note the single quote surrounding the option).

     <br><dt><code>-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=</code><var>sym</var><code>,</code><var>sym</var><code>,...</code><dd><a name="index-finstrument_002dfunctions_002dexclude_002dfunction_002dlist-1148"></a>
This is similar to <samp><span class="option">-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list</span></samp>,
but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its user-visible
name, such as <code>vector&lt;int&gt; blah(const vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;)</code>, not the
internal mangled name (e.g., <code>_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE</code>).  The
match is done on substrings: if the <var>sym</var> parameter is a substring
of the function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and C++
extended identifiers, the function name must be given in UTF-8, not
using universal character names.

     <br><dt><code>-fpatchable-function-entry=</code><var>N</var><code>[,</code><var>M</var><code>]</code><dd><a name="index-fpatchable_002dfunction_002dentry-1149"></a>Generate <var>N</var> NOPs right at the beginning
of each function, with the function entry point before the <var>M</var>th NOP. 
If <var>M</var> is omitted, it defaults to <code>0</code> so the
function entry points to the address just at the first NOP. 
The NOP instructions reserve extra space which can be used to patch in
any desired instrumentation at run time, provided that the code segment
is writable.  The amount of space is controllable indirectly via
the number of NOPs; the NOP instruction used corresponds to the instruction
emitted by the internal GCC back-end interface <code>gen_nop</code>.  This behavior
is target-specific and may also depend on the architecture variant and/or
other compilation options.

     <p>For run-time identification, the starting addresses of these areas,
which correspond to their respective function entries minus <var>M</var>,
are additionally collected in the <code>__patchable_function_entries</code>
section of the resulting binary.

     <p>Note that the value of <code>__attribute__ ((patchable_function_entry
(N,M)))</code> takes precedence over command-line option
<samp><span class="option">-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M</span></samp>.  This can be used to increase
the area size or to remove it completely on a single function. 
If <code>N=0</code>, no pad location is recorded.

     <p>The NOP instructions are inserted at&mdash;and maybe before, depending on
<var>M</var>&mdash;the function entry address, even before the prologue.
