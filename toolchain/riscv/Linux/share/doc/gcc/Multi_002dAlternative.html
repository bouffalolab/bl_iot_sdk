<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.3.2 Multiple Alternative Constraints</h5>

<p><a name="index-multiple-alternative-constraints-4021"></a>
Sometimes a single instruction has multiple alternative sets of possible
operands.  For example, on the 68000, a logical-or instruction can combine
register or an immediate value into memory, or it can combine any kind of
operand into a register; but it cannot combine one memory location into
another.

 <p>These constraints are represented as multiple alternatives.  An alternative
can be described by a series of letters for each operand.  The overall
constraint for an operand is made from the letters for this operand
from the first alternative, a comma, the letters for this operand from
the second alternative, a comma, and so on until the last alternative. 
All operands for a single instruction must have the same number of
alternatives.

 <p>So the first alternative for the 68000's logical-or could be written as
<code>"+m" (output) : "ir" (input)</code>.  The second could be <code>"+r"
(output): "irm" (input)</code>.  However, the fact that two memory locations
cannot be used in a single instruction prevents simply using <code>"+rm"
(output) : "irm" (input)</code>.  Using multi-alternatives, this might be
written as <code>"+m,r" (output) : "ir,irm" (input)</code>.  This describes
all the available alternatives to the compiler, allowing it to choose
the most efficient one for the current conditions.

 <p>There is no way within the template to determine which alternative was
chosen.  However you may be able to wrap your <code>asm</code> statements with
builtins such as <code>__builtin_constant_p</code> to achieve the desired results.
