<h5 class="subsubsection">6.45.5.1 Defining Global Register Variables</h5>

<p><a name="Global-Reg-Vars"></a><a name="index-global-register-variables-4037"></a><a name="index-registers_002c-global-variables-in-4038"></a><a name="index-registers_002c-global-allocation-4039"></a>
You can define a global register variable and associate it with a specified
register like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     register int *foo asm ("r12");
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Here <code>r12</code> is the name of the register that should be used. Note that
this is the same syntax used for defining local register variables, but for
a global variable the declaration appears outside a function. The
<code>register</code> keyword is required, and cannot be combined with
<code>static</code>. The register name must be a valid register name for the
target platform.

 <p>Registers are a scarce resource on most systems and allowing the
compiler to manage their usage usually results in the best code. However,
under special circumstances it can make sense to reserve some globally. 
For example this may be useful in programs such as programming language
interpreters that have a couple of global variables that are accessed
very often.

 <p>After defining a global register variable, for the current compilation
unit:

     <ul>
<li>The register is reserved entirely for this use, and will not be
allocated for any other purpose. 
<li>The register is not saved and restored by any functions. 
<li>Stores into this register are never deleted even if they appear to be
dead, but references may be deleted, moved or simplified. 
</ul>

 <p>Note that these points <em>only</em> apply to code that is compiled with the
definition. The behavior of code that is merely linked in (for example
code from libraries) is not affected.

 <p>If you want to recompile source files that do not actually use your global
register variable so they do not use the specified register for any other
purpose, you need not actually add the global register declaration to
their source code. It suffices to specify the compiler option
<samp><span class="option">-ffixed-</span><var>reg</var></samp> (see <a href="Code-Gen-Options.html#Code-Gen-Options">Code Gen Options</a>) to reserve the
register.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Declaring the variable</h5>

<p>Global register variables can not have initial values, because an
executable file has no means to supply initial contents for a register.

 <p>When selecting a register, choose one that is normally saved and
restored by function calls on your machine. This ensures that code
which is unaware of this reservation (such as library routines) will
restore it before returning.

 <p>On machines with register windows, be sure to choose a global
register that is not affected magically by the function call mechanism.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Using the variable</h5>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bqsort_007d_002c-and-global-register-variables-4040"></a>When calling routines that are not aware of the reservation, be
cautious if those routines call back into code which uses them. As an
example, if you call the system library version of <code>qsort</code>, it may
clobber your registers during execution, but (if you have selected
appropriate registers) it will restore them before returning. However
it will <em>not</em> restore them before calling <code>qsort</code>'s comparison
function. As a result, global values will not reliably be available to
the comparison function unless the <code>qsort</code> function itself is rebuilt.

 <p>Similarly, it is not safe to access the global register variables from signal
handlers or from more than one thread of control. Unless you recompile
them specially for the task at hand, the system library routines may
temporarily use the register for other things.

 <p><a name="index-register-variable-after-_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-4041"></a><a name="index-global-register-after-_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-4042"></a><a name="index-value-after-_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-4043"></a><a name="index-longjmp-4044"></a><a name="index-setjmp-4045"></a>On most machines, <code>longjmp</code> restores to each global register
variable the value it had at the time of the <code>setjmp</code>. On some
machines, however, <code>longjmp</code> does not change the value of global
register variables. To be portable, the function that called <code>setjmp</code>
should make other arrangements to save the values of the global register
variables, and to restore them in a <code>longjmp</code>. This way, the same
thing happens regardless of what <code>longjmp</code> does.

 <p>Eventually there may be a way of asking the compiler to choose a register
automatically, but first we need to figure out how it should choose and
how to enable you to guide the choice.  No solution is evident.
